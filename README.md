# 6DoF-RoboticArm-InverseKinematics

August 28th:
setting the dh_params in dh_params.py in utils
forward kinematics function in utils.utils, both for numpy and TF (for better processing time)
Trying to generate a dataset now in DatasetGen.py and in Notebooks (DatasetGeneration.ipynb)

-----
Now I am making a WebApp for this:
1. Dockerfile for the frontend and the backend
2. FASTAPI for backend and React for FrontEnd
3. Dockercompose for everything!
